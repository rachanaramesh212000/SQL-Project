## 🚀 About the Project
This case study is designed to strengthen SQL and data analysis skills by solving real-world style business questions for a fictional digital bank, Data Bank.
It focuses on SQL querying, customer behavior analysis, transactions, data allocation strategies, and performance metrics.

Inspired by Danny Ma’s #8WeekSQLChallenge.
