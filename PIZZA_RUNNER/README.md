## Question and Solution
Here are the answers with SQL queries.

**1. 1. How many pizzas were ordered?**

````sql
SELECT COUNT(order_id) AS total_pizzas
FROM customer_orders;
````
#### Steps:
- Use Select all `order_id` values from customer_orders.
- Use COUNT to calculate total rows (each row = 1 pizza).

#### Answer:
| total\_pizzas |
| ------------- |
| 14            |

- A total of 14 pizzas were ordered.

***
**Q2: How many unique customer orders were made?**

````sql
SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT order_id) AS unique_orders
FROM customer_orders;
````
#### Steps:
- Use COUNT(DISTINCT) on order_id.

#### Answer:
| unique\_orders |
| -------------- |
| 10             |

- There were 10 unique customer orders.

***
**Q3: How many successful orders were delivered by each runner?**

````sql
SELECT runner_id, COUNT(order_id) AS successful_orders
FROM runner_orders
WHERE cancellation IS NULL
GROUP BY runner_id;
````
#### Steps:
- Use WHERE cancellation IS NULL to filter successful deliveries.
- Group by runner_id.

#### Answer:
| runner\_id | successful\_orders |
| ---------- | ------------------ |
| 1          | 4                  |
